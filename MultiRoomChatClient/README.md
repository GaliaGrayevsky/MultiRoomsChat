# MultiRoomChatClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Or run `npm start` for a dev server which will open it on `http://localhost:1111/`.

## Author notes:

Work flow:

    Click on JOIN
    Choose nick name and then 
    Or create the new chat room, by choosing new room name
    Or choose room to join from the list. 

    In case nick name is already taken the message will be displayed and you will need to choose another name.

    You can join multiple rooms. You can change nick name in the middle, in case the new one is not taken.


No Save to firebase option was implemented, since I didn't have experience with it.
